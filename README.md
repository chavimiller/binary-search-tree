# binary-search-tree

This project is a Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation written in vanilla JavaScript to explore recursive algorithms and tree data structures. 
It constructs a balanced BST from a given array, removing duplicates and sorting values before building the structure. 
The Tree class includes key methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and multiple traversal orders (level-order, in-order, pre-order, and post-order).
The project also features methods to calculate the height and depth of nodes, determine whether the tree is balanced, and rebalance it when needed all implemented using recursion. 
A helper function, prettyPrint(), provides a clear visual representation of the tree’s structure in the console.

This project emphasizes the use of recursive algorithms for tree construction, traversal, and balancing, providing practical experience with algorithmic design patterns.
